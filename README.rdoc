First things first

Please run the following commands in linux (Ubuntu) terminal to install ROR and it's dependencies

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install curl

\curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable

Now close the terminal and open a new one and run the following commands

source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

rvm requirements

rvm install ruby

rvm use ruby --default

rvm rubygems current

sudo gem install rails

And you are done. 'ruby -v' and 'rails -v' will give you the version number
